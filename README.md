## Development

The application is written in TypeScript using React. In order to run the
application in development mode, you will need to have Node.js installed. After
cloning the repository, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. The application will be
available at http://localhost:3000.

## Production

The application can be built and run in production mode using Docker. To build
the application, run:

```bash
docker build -t sign .
```

This will create a Docker image called `sign`. To run the application, run:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 sign
```

This will start the application on port 3000. The application will be available
at http://localhost:3000.

## How to use

The application is a simple frontend for the sign API. It allows you to
generate horoscopes for a given sign and date. The application is available at
https://localhost:8443 after running the application in production mode.

In order to generate a horoscope, you will need to select a sign and press the
"Consultar hor√≥scopo" button. The application will then make a request to the
sign API and display the horoscope.
